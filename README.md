Absolutely! Let's break down and explain all the topics mentioned in your image one by one:

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Target Candidate Description**

* **Audience**: Beginner-level professionals.
* **Experience**: Up to 6 months of exposure to **AI/ML technologies on AWS**.
* **Note**: The candidate **uses** AI/ML services on AWS but **is not required to build** AI/ML solutions independently.

---

## ‚úÖ **Recommended AWS Knowledge (Detailed Explanation)**

---

### 1. **Core AWS Services**

You should be familiar with **what these services do** and their basic use cases:

* **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

  * Virtual servers in the cloud.
  * Used to run applications just like on a physical server.
  * Example: Hosting a web server or training ML models.

* **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

  * Object storage service.
  * Stores files like images, videos, datasets.
  * Example: Save AI training data or model output.

* **AWS Lambda**

  * Run code without managing servers.
  * Event-driven functions ‚Äî useful for triggers.
  * Example: Run preprocessing code when a new file is uploaded to S3.

* **Amazon SageMaker**

  * Fully managed service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.
  * You should know its purpose but not necessarily how to use it deeply.

---

### 2. **AWS Shared Responsibility Model**

* **Security model** that defines:

  * **AWS is responsible for**: Security **of** the cloud (hardware, infrastructure).
  * **You are responsible for**: Security **in** the cloud (your data, access control, application configurations).
* **Example**: AWS protects the physical servers, but you need to configure IAM roles and encrypt your data properly.

---

### 3. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

* Used to **control who can access what** in your AWS account.
* Concepts:

  * **Users and Groups**
  * **Roles**
  * **Policies (permissions)**
* **Example**: Allow data scientists to access SageMaker but not EC2 or billing.

---

### 4. **AWS Global Infrastructure**

Understand the basic structure of how AWS delivers services globally:

* **Regions**: Separate geographic areas (e.g., US-East, Asia-Pacific).
* **Availability Zones**: Each region has multiple isolated locations for redundancy.
* **Edge Locations**: Used for content delivery (via CloudFront).

**Example Use**: When deploying an AI model, choosing the right region ensures lower latency and compliance with data laws.

---

### 5. **AWS Pricing Models**

You don‚Äôt need deep billing knowledge, but should understand:

* **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for what you use.
* **Free Tier**: Some services are free for limited usage (great for learning).
* **Pricing factors**: Storage size, compute time, data transfer, etc.

**Example**: SageMaker Studio charges for notebook instances and model training time separately.

Here‚Äôs a **detailed and simplified explanation** of what you need to learn from this page for your AWS AI/ML certification preparation:

---

## üî¥ **Things You Are NOT Expected to Do (Out of Scope Tasks)**

These are advanced tasks that **you don‚Äôt need to learn** for this exam. You just need to **understand they are out of scope**.

### ‚ùå You don‚Äôt need to:

1. **Develop or code AI/ML models**

   * Example: Writing a neural network in Python is out of scope.

2. **Do data engineering or feature engineering**

   * Example: Creating data pipelines or transforming raw data using Spark or Pandas is not expected.

3. **Perform hyperparameter tuning or model optimization**

   * You don‚Äôt need to adjust model settings like learning rate, epochs, etc.

4. **Build and deploy AI/ML pipelines**

   * You don‚Äôt need to use tools like SageMaker Pipelines or MLOps tools.

5. **Do statistical or mathematical analysis of ML models**

   * You don‚Äôt need to calculate precision, recall, or build confusion matrices.

6. **Implement security or compliance for AI/ML**

   * Creating security frameworks specifically for ML is out of scope.

7. **Design governance or policies for AI/ML solutions**

   * No need to worry about AI ethics, auditing, or compliance regulations.

üëâ **Focus on using AI/ML services**, not building or configuring deep internals.

---

## ‚úÖ **What Kind of Questions to Expect in the Exam**

The exam has different question **types**. You need to **practice and be familiar with each type**:

---

### 1. **Multiple Choice**

* **1 correct answer**, 3 wrong ones (distractors).
* ‚úÖ Example:
  What is an AWS service used for object storage?

  * A. EC2
  * B. Lambda
  * **C. S3** ‚úÖ
  * D. DynamoDB

---

### 2. **Multiple Response**

* 2 or more correct answers out of 5+ choices.
* You must **select all correct options** to get marks.
* ‚ùó No partial marks.

‚úÖ Example:
Which of the following are compute services?

* A. S3
* **B. EC2** ‚úÖ
* **C. Lambda** ‚úÖ
* D. RDS
* E. IAM

---

### 3. **Ordering**

* You are given 3‚Äì5 steps.
* You must **arrange them in the correct order**.

‚úÖ Example:
Steps to upload a file to Amazon S3:

1. Create an S3 bucket
2. Configure permissions
3. Upload file

---

### 4. **Matching**

* Match a list of 3‚Äì7 items correctly with another list.
* Must match all pairs correctly.

‚úÖ Example:
Match the AWS service with its function:

* EC2 ‚Üí Run servers
* S3 ‚Üí Store files
* RDS ‚Üí Manage databases

---

### 5. **Case Study**

* One big scenario with 2 or more related questions.
* Scenario stays the same for all questions.
* Each answer is **evaluated individually**, so no need to get all right to get marks.

‚úÖ Example:
You‚Äôre given a case about a company using SageMaker.
Q1: Which service should they use to label data?
Q2: Which instance type suits training?

---

## ‚úÖ Summary: What You Should Focus On

| Area                 | What to Do                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå Out-of-Scope Tasks | Just understand you're not building/tuning ML models.           |
| ‚úÖ Question Types     | Practice multiple choice, matching, ordering, and case studies. |
| üß† Skills Needed     | Understand AWS ML-related services and how to use them.         |
